• What are the benefits of using CSS?


- (1)Faster Page Speed‎

  More Code Means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code.CSS allows you to use one CSS 
  rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document 

- (2)Better User Experience

  CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When butt
  -ons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.

-(3)Quicker Development Time‏
  
 With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code
 One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have
 product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page
 will suffice for all pages of that same type.

-(4) Easy Formatting Changes
 If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no
 need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes
 applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.

-(5) Compatibility Across Devices
 Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable
 on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive
 design possible 


• What are the disadvantages of CSS?


-(1). Confusion due to many CSS levels
 Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue. They might get confused while opting to learn CSS as there 
 are many levels of CSS such as CSS2, CSS3, etc.

-(2). Cross-Browser Issues
 Different browsers work differently. So, you have to check that changes implemented in the website via 
 CSS codes are reflected properly among all browsers.

-(3). Security Issues
 Security is important in today’s world driven by technology and data. One of the major disadvantages of
 CSS is that it has limited security.

-(4). Extra Work for Developers
 Design services are required to consider and test all CSS codes across different browsers for compatibility.
 Due to developers testing compatibility for different browsers, their workload increases.


• What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?


- the biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 in now split in to different modules.


• Name a few CSS style components


- The compontent of css style are (1)selector;element selector,class selector,id selector,universel selector,
  desended selector,adjecent sibling,general sibling,child selector,gruping selector  (2))Property:It's 
  like an attribute such as background color,font-size,position,text-align,color,border etc.(3)value:
  Values:which defines property or values allocate for properties.


• What do you understand by CSS opacity?


- The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an
  element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.


• How can the background color of an element be changed?

 
- To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code 
  you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a
  table, heading, div, or span tag


• How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?


- This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the 
  repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both 
  horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not


• What is the use of the background-position property? 


- The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a 
  background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally


• Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 


- The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, 
  or is fixed.


• Why should background and color be used as separate properties?


- The major difference between CSS background vs background-color property is that the background property
  is shorthand of all background properties. On the other hand, the background-color property is the subset
  of the background property used to set the background color.


• How to center block elements using CSS1? 


- So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.


• How to maintain the CSS specifications?

- 


• What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?

 
- CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
  Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section. External - by using a <link> element to link
  to an external CSS file


• What is embedded style sheets? 


- Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place.
  This is done by embedding the <style></style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.


• What are the external style sheets?


- An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section
  of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style
  sheet is placed within the head section of the page


• What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?


- External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:

- one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages
- you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements
- consistent look and feel across multiple web pages
- improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as needed


• What is the meaning of the CSS selector?


- A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser
  which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.


• What are the media types allowed by CSS?

 
- One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on 
  different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.

- Certain CSS properties are only designed for certain media (e.g., the 'page-break-before' property only applies 
  to paged media). On occasion, however, style sheets for different media types may share a property, but require
  different values for that property. For example, the 'font-size' property is useful both for screen and print 
  media. The two media types are different enough to require different values for the common property; a document
  will typically need a larger font on a computer screen than on paper. Therefore, it is necessary to express that
  a style sheet, or a section of a style sheet, applies to certain media types.


• What is the rule set?


- A collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against to determine an 
  action to take—such as forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or allowing a system event.
